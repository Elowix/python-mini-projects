## PC Games Scraper

This project is a simple web scraper that extracts the names of the top PC games from the PC Gamer website. Using Python's `requests` library, it sends an HTTP request to the designated URL, retrieves the webpage content, and then parses the HTML using `BeautifulSoup`.

## Features
- Retrieves the list of top PC games for a given year.
- Extracts game names from specific HTML elements.
- Outputs the game names to the console.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `BeautifulSoup` (part of `bs4`)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python pc_games_scraper.py
   ```
   
## Goals
I intend to develop this very small project to utilize nearly all the important features that this powerful module offers. In the future, there may be a vast world of examples here for learning and entertainment.
