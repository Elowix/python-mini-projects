# Lottery Drawing with Python

This project is a simple Python program that allows you to enter names and randomly select winners. It is designed for events, competitions, and any kind of lottery drawing.

## Features

- Interactive name entry
- Ability to specify the number of winners
- Random selection of winners

## Example

```
chand barande mikhay dashte bashi?: 2
esme ro vared kon: Ali
esme ro vared kon: Sara
esme ro vared kon: end
shoma ghore ro be payan resondi
['Ali', 'Sara']
barande nafare 1 ghore: Ali
barande nafare 2 ghore: Sara
```

## Notes

- If you enter 0 for the number of winners, the program will display a message and avoid continuing.
- Empty name entries are not allowed and the program handles this case.
